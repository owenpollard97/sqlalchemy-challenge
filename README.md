In this project, I used Python and SQLAlchemy to analyze climate data from a provided database called hawaii.sqlite. I used Jupyter Notebook (climate_starter.ipynb) to perform my analysis. First, I conducted a precipitation analysis by finding the most recent date and querying the previous 12 months of precipitation data. Then, I plotted the results and printed summary statistics using Pandas. Next, I analyzed the stations by calculating the total number of stations and finding the most active ones based on observation counts. Afterward, I queried temperature observations for the most active station in the previous year and plotted the results as a histogram. Finally, I designed a Flask API to showcase my analysis, with routes for the homepage, precipitation data, station list, temperature observations, and minimum, average, and maximum temperatures for specified date ranges.
